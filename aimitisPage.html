            <p>Aimitis is a progressive web app (PWA). Why did we decide to create a PWA instead of a native app?
                In our research of domestic violence prevention apps in Ireland, we became aware of a significant
                barrier. Anyone who purchased
                an iPhone in a foreign country could not download Ireland-specific apps. Many of the women in our
                group where from China or America
                we were unable to download and use these services.

                <h2>Problem Statement: </h2>
            </div>
            <p>Alarming statistics highlight the persistent issue of domestic violence, with 47% of European women aged
                19-29 experiencing psychological violence since age 15. In Ireland, 1 in 6 Irish women faces physical or
                sexual violence from their partner by age 15. Shockingly, 49% of abused women globally never report or
                seek help, suggesting even higher unacknowledged numbers.
                <br>
                <br>
                In our comprehensive research we discovered three critical voids in the education and protection against
                domestic violence in Ireland:
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="PS_Grid">
            <div class="PS_One">1. Accessing Support: Existing online support systems suffer from broken links an
                inadequate coverage for both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. The interface is outdated and
                cumbersome, especially for users with non-EU devices, creating barriers for women seeking help.
            </div>
            <div class="PS_Two">2. Youth Education Gap: Current resources fail to engage young women entering the dating
                world. Traditional educational methods do not align with today’s youth, who prefer short video formats
                like reels. This lack of relevant, up-to-date information perpetuates an educational deficit.</div>

            <div class="PS_Three">3. Obtaining a cord order of protection relies on women’s ability to provide evidence
                of abuse, posing a significant risk for those living with their abuser. Safely compiling crucial
                information can become high risk, potentially escalating the dangers they face.</div>

            <p>Our team extensively researched domestic abuse globally and in Ireland, including analyzing articles,

                warning signs, healthy relationships, and readiness, forming the basis for articles and skincare-themed
                reels.<br><br>
                We consulted professionals for insights on discreetly seeking help. Locating women’s refugee centers in
                Ireland was challenging due to closures, relocations, and outdated information, requiring
                cross-referencing with organizations like Safe Ireland, Women’s Aid, and Google for updates in both the
                Republic and Northern Ireland.

            <p>In shaping Aimitis’ visual identity, we aimed to support women in Ireland while promoting domestic
