            <p>Thorough research was essential for comprehending the distinctive logos, aesthetics, and color
                palettes
                of each company and building. This knowledge was pivotal in understanding the alignment of K-pop
                groups
                with their respective companies. Utilizing this information, we systematically organized colors,
                themes,
                and aesthetics.</p>
            <p>To gain insights into these elements, we extensively examined popular K-pop blogs, K-pop group
                Instagram
                pages, TikToks, Twitter accounts, and fan pages across various social media platforms. The spectrum
                of
                K-pop colors and aesthetics spans from vibrant and dynamic to serene and monochromatic. These
                aesthetic

            <p>Our aim was to create an immersive experience that bridges K-pop enthusiasts with the world they

                Through thoughtful user experience design, we crafted intuitive navigation and interactions that
                effortlessly guide users through the vibrant world of K-pop company buildings. Our platform's

                and
                clarity. We sketched out the basic arrangement of navigation menus, content sections, and

            <p>After gaining an idea of key elements and page layout we moved to digital low-fi wireframes. These

                of
                our platform. During this phase, we focused on the core elements and layout, prioritizing

            <p>As our design vision evolved, we transitioned to high-fidelity (high-fi) wireframes. These wireframes

                In the high-fi wireframes, every design element received meticulous attention. Typography choices
                were
                refined to align with the specific aesthetics of different sections. Color palettes were curated to
