            <p class="medApp-intro">medAware is a mobile app that allows a person to look up medication to find what
                foods to monitor or
                avoid while on specific medications. Along with side effects associated with the medication.</p>

                    dietary restriction not always being easy to find, and the effects this may have on the body or
                    medication.
                    Through this, I developed an app that easily allows one to look up specific medications and has a
                    full
                    list of foods that should be avoided or monitored while on the medications. </P>

                <p>Access to comprehensive prescription information is often challenging and can be frustrating for
                    individuals, leaving them with unanswered questions. This problem is even greater caregivers,
                    especially when family members step in to be caregivers. Finding reliable resources and relaying
                    this information can be difficult and challenging. The lack of easily accessible and user-friendly
                    resources for medication-related dietary restriction and side effects can lead to unwanted dietary
                    choices that negatively interact with medication, potentially causing further health risks and
                    reduced medication effectiveness.</p>

                <p>I collaborated with Clemencia Rodriguez, a 5th-year pharmacy student, to make complex medical
                    information more accessible. Together, we translated medical terms into user-friendly language. With
                    Clemencia's guidance, I developed medAware, a mobile app, to empower users with easy access to
                    medication-food interaction information. This app enhances medication management, user confidence,
                    and overall health outcomes for prescription drug users.</p>

            <p><u>Research:</u><br>
                During my initial research, I interviewed multiple individuals who are care givers to family members, or
                work in the at home nursing industry. Many of these interviewees stressed, that the interface of the app
                needs to be large enough for them to read, easily understandable, and ‘not fussy’ to use.

            <p><u>Interface Design:</u><br>The color scheme of the app followed the colors of pharmacies, and many
                medical
                professions. Teal, blue, orange white, and black are the primaries. Secondary Colors consist of green
                and red.<br><br>
                For the typography, Navigo was chosen. Because this typeface is thicker, it is easier for users to read.
                Black was used for the type face to encourage enough contrast for users to easily read the medical
                information they are looking up.<br><br>
                Buttons are large so users recognize them and help with touch. Button shape is maintained is the same
                throughout the entire app to help with the consistency of user interactions and navigation.

                <p><u>Lo-fi Wireframes</u><br>
                    In the lo-fi stage of wireframing, I kept in mind the age range for this app is wide, and
                    technological gaps needed to be bridged for all users to have an intuitive and enjoyable user
                    experience. Clearly organized information was crucial for the success of the app’s interface and
                    usability. </p>

            <p><u>Hi-fi Wireframes:</u><br>

                In the hi-fi wireframing stage, we prioritized micro-interactions like voice-to-text input, task-saving,
                and smooth transitions between app screens. These micro-interactions significantly improved the user
                experience, adding convenience, intuitiveness, and immediate feedback. User testing confirmed their
                positive impact on creating a responsive and user-centric app.

            Collaborating with Clemencia, we harnessed this valuable information to develop an intuitive mobile
            application. This app serves as a comprehensive resource, offering individuals a deeper
            understanding of which foods to carefully consider or keep an eye on. Whether individuals are
            proactively managing their dietary choices or assisting others in doing so, our app provides
            valuable insights. It's important to note that we recommend all users consult with their healthcare
            provider before initiating any new medication or dietary regimen, ensuring their health and
            well-being are prioritized.
